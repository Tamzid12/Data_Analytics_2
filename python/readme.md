# Python assignments and Projects:

1. In **Unit 2**, we learned about the basics of Python, such as list, dictionary, and build-in functions. We also learned about for loop, if-else statement, and so on.

   b. We have two mini projects for this unit.
      - Check if the input is odd or even, if it is multiple of 4. More generally, define a function that takes in two numbers and check whether the first number is divisible by the second.

2. In **unit 3**, we learned about the functions within *numpy*, *pandas*, and *matplotlib* packages. We see examples of data wrangling and data visualization. 
   
   a. In [assignment 1](https://github.com/Tamzid12/Data_Analytics_2/blob/main/python/Unit3_NumPy_Assignment_1.ipynb), I practiced using *numpy* package to find the maximum within an array, and subset array according to certain criteria. 
   
   b. In [assignment 2](https://github.com/Tamzid12/Data_Analytics_2/blob/main/python/Unit3_Python_Advanced_Pandas_DataWrangling_Assignment.ipynb), I did data analysis using salaries dataset. I calculated mean, median, and I did basic data transformations on the dataset, such as rename and subset columns. I visualized the dataset by making scatter plots and histograms. Lastly, I draw conclusions based on the plots. 
   
   c. The project for this unit is on the hot topic of the year, COVID 19. The codes for the first 4 tasks were set up clearly. After carefully reading all the codes and statements, I did some analysis on the states that have high death case. I answered the following questions:
   
      - Which five states have the highest number of death?
      - Analysis of COVID 19 in the 5 states since December 22nd. 
      - A different approach to calculating new cases.

3. In **Unit 4**, we learned about Machine Learning. More specifically, we learned various ML methods such as *linear regression*, *logistic regression*, *K-Nearest Neighbors*, *decision trees*, and *random forest*.
   
   a. We worked on two examples on using logistic regression. We learned about the confusion matrix, the difference between recall, precision, and accuracy, what is ROC-curve, and how to interpret it.    
   
      - [Predict survival with Titanic dataset]

      - [Predict ad clicking behavior with advertising dataset](https://github.com/Tamzid12/Data_Analytics_2/blob/main/python/Machine_Learning_Logistic_Regression_Guided_Project.ipynb)
      
   b. We use `Classified` dataset to examine KNN method. We learned about how to standardize data, how different K-values change predictions, and how to pick the right K-value.
      - [Predict class with classified dataset](https://github.com/Tamzid12/Data_Analytics_2/blob/main/python/Unit_4_ML_KNN_Assignment.ipynb)
     
   c. Random forest: I re-predicted ad clicking behavior by using a random forest classifier, and I worked out another example found at DataCamp.com on the famous iris dataset. I re-predicted Boston Housing price by using a random forest regressor and got $R^2$ = 0.87 (significantly better than other methods). I worked on another example of predicting temperature. 
   
   We worked on **Amazon Alexa review project**. From this project, I learned about how to do one-hot encoding using `get_dummies`, and how to convert a column that contains sentences, e.g., reviews,  into numerical values using `CountVectorizer` and understand the idea behind the algorithm. I learned about feature importance and understand that fewer features can improve our model's performance since there is less noise. I also looked into the learning curve of my models to see if feeding more data to the model can improve performance.
